# Branch Merge Lab

This repository is designed to help you practice and understand different Git merge strategies and scenarios.

## Scenarios Covered

1. **Fast-Forward Merge** - When the target branch hasn't diverged
2. **Three-Way Merge** - When both branches have new commits
3. **Merge Conflicts** - When the same lines are modified in both branches
4. **Rebase vs Merge** - Comparing different integration strategies
5. **Squash Merge** - Combining multiple commits into one

## Getting Started

Each scenario is demonstrated in separate branches. Follow the instructions in each section to practice different merge strategies.

## Initial Setup

This is the main branch with the initial project structure.
